# EstradaBot - Claude Code Project Instructions

## Session Startup (MANDATORY)

**Before doing ANY work, always run these verification steps and report the results to the developer:**

1. Run `git fetch origin` to get the latest remote state
2. Run `git branch --show-current` to confirm the active branch
3. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
4. Run `git log --oneline -1` to show the current local commit
5. Run `git log --oneline -1 origin/master` to show the latest remote master commit
6. Compare local vs remote — if the branch is behind, **warn the developer** before proceeding

**Report format:**
```
SESSION CHECK:
  Branch:          <current branch>
  Local commit:    <short hash + message>
  Remote master:   <short hash + message>
  Status:          UP TO DATE | BEHIND BY X COMMITS | UNCOMMITTED CHANGES
  Ready to work:   YES | NO — <reason>
```

If the branch is behind remote or has merge conflicts, do NOT begin work until the developer decides how to handle it.

## Protocols

### Melt Banana Protocol (MBP) — Batch Requirement Collection
**Full spec:** `protocols/mbp.md`
- **Start:** "Initiate MBP" → STOP all actions, enter collection mode. Acknowledge each prompt with a numbered receipt. Write to `memory.md`.
- **Go:** "Melt Banana" / "Cook the Cavendish" → Present consolidated briefing, offer to deglaze, then execute full speed.
- **Abort:** "Cancel MBP" / "Stand down" → Keep notes in memory.md, return to normal.
- **Critical rule:** Never build during collection. Never reorder Sean's items. MBP state survives context compression.

### Deglazing Protocol — Critical Review
**Full spec:** `protocols/deglazing.md`
- **Start:** "Deglaze" / "Deglaze the pan" / "Deglaze [target]" / "Let's deglaze what we just talked about"
- **Targets:** Documents, conversations, or MBP collections.
- **Report sections:** The Fond (still good), Burnt Bits (problems), Missing Ingredients (gaps), Open Questions (`DG-Q1`...), Recommendations.
- **Critical rule:** Never edit or execute before presenting the report. Be genuinely critical — don't rubber-stamp.

**When a protocol is triggered, read the full spec file before proceeding.**

## Key Conventions

### Git Workflow
- **Main branch:** `master`
- **Feature branches:** Create a new branch for each feature or fix
- **Pull requests:** All changes to `master` go through a PR with review (for team members)
- **Owner direct deploy:** When the project owner (InnerLooper85) explicitly requests a deploy during a Claude Code session, Claude may merge directly to `master` and push without creating a PR. This bypasses GitHub review for speed. All other contributors must still use PRs.
- **Commit messages:** Short, descriptive — explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Never force push to `master`
- Always pull the latest `master` before creating a new branch

### Code Style
- Python code follows PEP 8
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings to new functions and classes
- Keep Flask routes in `backend/app.py`
- Keep scheduling logic in `backend/algorithms/`
- Keep file parsing in `backend/parsers/`
- Keep export logic in `backend/exporters/`

### File Handling
- All file I/O goes through GCS in production (`backend/gcs_storage.py`)
- Local file paths are only for development
- Input files are Excel (.xlsx) — use openpyxl/pandas for reading
- Output files are Excel (.xlsx) — use openpyxl for writing

### Environment Variables
- Never hardcode secrets — use environment variables
- Reference `.env.example` for the full list of required variables
- Production secrets are managed in GCP (env.yaml, not committed to git)

---

## Sensitive Files — DO NOT Commit

- `.env` — local environment variables with passwords
- `env.yaml` — production environment variables
- Any file containing passwords, API keys, or secrets
- `DEPLOY.md` contains credentials — it is currently committed but should be treated as sensitive reference material

---

## Testing Changes Locally

```bash
# Create/activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy and configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your local settings

# Run the development server
python run_production.py
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5000

---

## Deploying to Production

Deployment is done via Google Cloud Run from the repo root:

```bash
gcloud run deploy estradabot --source . --region us-central1 --allow-unauthenticated
```

### Owner Direct Deploy (fast path)

When the project owner says "deploy", "merge and deploy", "push to production", or similar during a Claude Code session, follow this streamlined process:

1. Complete the **Versioning Protocol** below (version badge, update log, CLAUDE.md)
2. Commit changes on the feature branch and push
3. Switch to `master`, pull latest, merge the feature branch
4. Push `master` to origin
5. Report: "Merged to master and pushed. Ready for `gcloud run deploy`."

**Note:** The actual `gcloud run deploy` command must be run by the owner on their local machine (Claude Code does not have gcloud credentials). Claude's job is to get `master` ready.

### Standard Deploy (team members)

**Before deploying:**
1. Ensure all tests pass locally
2. Ensure your changes are committed and pushed
3. Create a PR and get it reviewed/approved
4. Merge via GitHub
5. Coordinate with the team — only one deploy at a time
6. Verify the live site after deployment: https://estradabot.biz

## Versioning Protocol (MANDATORY for production releases)

**Current Version:** MVP 1.9.0

### Version Numbering: `X.Y.Z`

- **X** — Major release. Only bumped when the product owner declares a new major milestone.
- **Y** — Feature release. Bumped for new features or significant enhancements (set by the project stage last implemented, e.g., MVP 1.8 = the 8th feature release).
- **Z** — Patch/bugfix. Iterated for each bugfix or minor correction within the current feature release (e.g., 1.8.1, 1.8.2, ...). Resets to 0 on a new Y bump.

When merging changes to `master` that will be deployed to production, you MUST:

1. **Increment the version badge** in `backend/templates/base.html`
   - Find the `<span class="badge bg-info ...>MVP X.Y.Z</span>` in the navbar brand
   - Bump Z (1.8.1 → 1.8.2) for bugfixes and minor corrections
   - Bump Y (1.8 → 1.9) for feature additions, reset Z to 0
   - Bump X (1.x → 2.0) only when the product owner declares a new major release

2. **Update the Update Log page** in `backend/templates/update_log.html`
   - Add a new version section at the top of the "Version History" card (above the previous version)
   - Include the version badge, date, and a short release name
   - List each change as a `<li class="list-group-item">` with a description
   - Follow the existing format (see MVP 1.0 and MVP 1.1 entries as examples)

3. **Update this file** — change "Current Version" above to match the new version

**Do NOT deploy to production without completing all three steps.**

## Team Coordination

- Before starting work on a feature, check the GitHub project board and open PRs
- If someone else is working on the same area, coordinate before making changes
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/add-rework-tracking`, `fix/hot-list-parsing`
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Review teammates' PRs promptly
