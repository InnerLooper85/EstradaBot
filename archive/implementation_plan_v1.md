# Implementation Plan v1 — Archive

**Archived:** February 15, 2026
**Reason:** Original implementation plan (81KB) contained completed MVP 1.0-1.1 phases with code examples from the initial React/Node.js design that was never used. The actual stack is Python/Flask. This file is preserved for historical reference.

**Active planning documents:**
- `CLAUDE.md` — Project instructions and conventions
- `memory.md` — Current session memory and active state
- `MVP_2.0_Planning.md` — Future feature planning
- `planning/` — Phase-based planning for MVP 2.0 (when active)

The original `implementation_plan.md` has been replaced with a lean status summary.
